## Hello! Nice to meet you!

I am Alejandro Aísa, PhD candidate at the University of Konstanz under the supervision of Dr. Belén González. At the university, I am also a member of the [Communication, Networks and Contention](https://www.polver.uni-konstanz.de/cnc/) research group. 

My primary academic interest is the study of protest events through image analysis techniques. Fortunately, I form part of the "Dynamics of Mass Protests" Project (DMP project), where I can research about different factors that turn protests violent, using images. The project is led by PIs Dr. Belén González, Prof. Dr. Nils B. Weidmann and Prof. Dr. Christian Von Soest.
