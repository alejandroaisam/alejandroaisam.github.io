I am Alejandro Aísa, second year PhD at the University of Konstanz under the supervision of Dr. Belén González. At the university, I am also a member of the [Communication, Networks and Contention](https://www.polver.uni-konstanz.de/cnc/) research group. 

My research focuses on protests and image analysis. Fortunately, I form part of the "Dynamics of Mass Protest" Project (DMP project), where I research different factors that turn protest violent. 

## Other research interests 

- Data science and machine learning 
- Ethnic conflicts
